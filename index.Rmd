# Preface {-}

```{r RUNFIRST, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment=NA, cache=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60), tidy=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%')
```

This is material that was developed as part of a course we teach at the University of Washington on applied time series analysis for fisheries and environmental data.  You can find our lectures on our course website [ATSA](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/).

### Book package {-}

The book uses a number of R packages and a variety of fisheries data sets.  The packages and data sets can be installed by installing our  **atsalibrary** package which is hosted on GitHub:

```{r preface-load-atsa, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("nwfsc-timeseries/atsalibrary")
```

### Authors {-}

The authors are United States federal research scientists.  This work was conducted as part of our jobs at the  Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), a research center for NOAA Fisheries, and the United States Geological Survey, which are United States federal government agencies. E. Holmes and E. Ward are affiliate faculty and M. Scheuerell is an associate professor at the University of Washington.
